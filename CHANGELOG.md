# Changelog

## Unreleased

- Generalize the opt-in migration facility from plaintext adoption to legacy
  formats through `LegacyFormat`. `RowState::Plaintext` is now
  `RowState::Legacy`, `SweepReport::plaintext` is now `SweepReport::legacy`, and
  `MaybeEncrypted::is_plaintext` is now `MaybeEncrypted::is_legacy`.
- Defer decoding non-envelope bytes until a `MaybeEncrypted` decrypt call. A
  legacy codec error now occurs during decryption instead of `from_bytes` or
  SQLx `Decode`.
